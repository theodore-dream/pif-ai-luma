Through sleepless nights, I search for solace,
But the terrors persist, relentless in their malice,
My will weakened, swallowed by this chalice.

In the garden of my mind, entangled in despair,
Anxiety blooms, suffocating the air,
A prisoner to my fears, in this eternal snare.

In the garden of my mind, shadows loom,
Each whisper further seals my impending doom,
Dread's tendrils coil, consuming every room.

Fear resides, a serpent slithering within,
Its venomous fangs sink deep, beneath my skin,
I am but a captive, bound by my own sin.

Paranoia grips tightly, its cold embrace,
Every step, every breath, a frantic race,
My mind, a labyrinth, lost in endless space.

Visions of danger dance in flickering light,
Phantoms haunting, conjured in the dead of night,
I try to flee, but they hold me tight.

Through sleepless nights, I search for solace,
But the terrors persist, relentless in their malice,
My will weakened, swallowed by this chalice.

In the garden of my mind, entangled in despair,
Anxiety blooms, suffocating the air,
A prisoner to my fears, in this eternal snare.
